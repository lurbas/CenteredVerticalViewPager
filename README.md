# CenteredVerticalViewPager

Copy of [VerticalViewPager].

Added preview for next and previous page. Also includes custom PageTransformer which layout current item in center of viewport. Main use case is creating vertical feed, where user's focus is on one particular item, and everything else fades away. It's compatible with SwipeRefreshLayout.

Includes library and sample project.
